		    good to know what your classmates are expecting and what they want to learn along with taking your own goals into persepective. 

VERSION or DATE:This is my secind version, my first version idea I couldn't quite execute 

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:I Struggled being able to get an input from the user so I had to settle with just printing everyone's goals at once after compling the code and running it. 

AUTHORS: Morgan Gant 

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
The output is hard to read and definitly needs to be formatted better but I haven't learned how to format outputs from an array that were read in from a text file.
