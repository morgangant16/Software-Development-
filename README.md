# Software-Development-

PROJECT TITLE: 
Software development first program 

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
Display student's goals for the semester. In order to get to know eahcother and get the most out of the class it's good to know what your 
classmates are expecting and what they want to learn along with taking your own goals into persepective. 

VERSION or DATE: 
This is my second version of this program, my first version idea I couldn't quite execute.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 
Download the txt file and be able to copy the provided classes into your own BlueJay account

AUTHORS: 
Morgan Gant 

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
The output is hard to read and definitly needs to be formatted better but I haven't learned how to format outputs from an array that were read in from a text file.  
To download BlueJay, simply look up Bluejay download in any browser. Click the first link and it should take you to a screen that has a few different options of how it can be downloaded based on what operating system you use ie: windows 10, Mac, etc. It will take a little while to load so be patient, mine took about 45 minutes. Once it's downloaded you can open up the app and follow the commands asked which should be clicking next and finish. Once the app installs, you can go into your apps and open it. It should open to a screen that will have an option that says "project" click on that to start a new project, open two classes, copy the code I provided, click the compile button at the top of the class in both that you opened. Then, go back to the screen where you can see both classes and the text file, two finger tap on the class named SDgoals2 (use the same class names I did, as they are used in the program), you should get a drop down menu, click the Void Main(String[] args), push okay and a new window should open with everyone in the class and their goals! 

NOTE: I frogot to mention in my video- you will need to download my txt file and put it in the same file as your BlueJay project in your computer files so that when you run the program it can access the file! Attached below is a short clip of a more indepth explanation!
