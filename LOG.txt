2021- August-26: 1 Hour: Thinking about what language would be best to use and a mental outline of how to structure it
2021- August-27: 2 Hours: Researching the best way to structrue a Hashmap to link keys and values together only to decide I wanted to create a student class
2021- August-29: 3 Hours: Refreshing my knowldge on creating classes in Java becasue it's been a couple years, putting goals into a text file, splitting the 
                          text file by a ":", sorting the parts into an array and trying to output the information correctly
2021- August-30: 2 Hours: Trying different output methods by taking in a student name and outputting the goals after the searched name went through the array 
2021- August-31: 5 Hours: Tried implementing and changing my program to output the information correclty but failed to do so. Had to settle with all the goals being 
                          outputted at once. I also downloaded GutHub, created a README, made a software video that included redownloading my software that took 45 minutes and                               uploaded all the class work that I could! 

Total hours: 13

Things I'd like to learn:
- Basici of GitHub, I have never used it and I'd like to know how to do things on it efficiently 
- How much inforamtion goes into a README and what are things to leave out 
- Search for a string in a parted array and output the desired information 
- Formatting outputs that are stored in an aray that were read in through a text file
